## What is Natsumi Browser?
Natsumi Browser (or Natsumi, for short) is a skin made for [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app)
that adds lots of polish to the design by incorporating animations, blurs and more. It's pretty much
the skin I personally use, but made public because people wanted the CSS.

Natsumi is NOT a standalone browser. I don't even intend on making one.

Natsumi has been tested on `1.7.4b` (Beta) and `1.7.4t 2025-01-30` (Twilight).

## Features
### Polished look
Natsumi Browser sports a modern look to bring you a beautiful and polished browsing experience, while
keeping much of Zen Browser's original design.

### Natsumi URLbar
With Natsumi URLbar, Natsumi gives the expanded URLbar a completely fresh new look, so it feels very
cozy while also having lots of room for search suggestions.

### Natsumi Findbar
Say hello to Natsumi Findbar! Natsumi Findbar shares a similar design as Natsumi URLbar, bringing you
the same cozy and modern experience. Inspired by [RobotoSkunk](https://github.com/RobotoSkunk)'s [Better
Find Bar](https://zen-browser.app/mods/a6335949-4465-4b71-926c-4a52d34bc9c0/) Mod.

### Natsumi PDF Viewer
Send your PDF viewer to the 21st century! Natsumi Browser Pages includes tweaks for the default PDF
viewer, giving it the modern look it really deserves.

### Enhanced sidebars
Elevate your sidebars to the next level! Not only does Natsumi add a glass effect to both sidebars, it
also makes the Firefox sidebar more customizable by adding customization for its size and position.

## Browser configs (in about:config)

and delay, change the variables in the config.css file.

### Base theme
- `natsumi.theme.clip-path-force-polygon`: Uses polygon instead of inset for URLbar and Zen Sidebar
  blurring. Enable this if you need this for compatibility with other userchromes/Mods like

## FAQs
### "Can I use other userchromes with Natsumi?"
Sure! Just paste it right below the Natsumi Browser loader (userChrome.css) and you can use your own
userchrome alongside Natsumi Browser.

### "Can I disable individual features?"
You're free to disable loading certain modules (CSS files) if you feel like it. But you will still need
to load config.css, natsumi/preload.css and natsumi/postload.css for things to work.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with the newest version of Zen Browser?"
New versions of Natsumi are developed and tested on Zen Twilight, so that it will be compatible with the
latest version of Zen Browser as close as possible to the release date.

If you are unsure if Natsumi is compatible with your version, check the tested versions in the beginning
of the README.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with Firefox, Chrome, Arc, etc.?"
No. Natsumi is made on top of Zen Browser, so a LOT of things will break if you try to apply it on
Firefox or other Firefox-based browsers.

As for Chrome/Chromium-based browsers like Arc, you can't apply userchrome CSS files, making Natsumi
completely incompatible with those browsers.

### "Can I use Natsumi with other Zen Mods?"
You can, but some mods (such as Better Find Bar and Super Url Bar) may conflict with Natsumi's CSS
rules. If this happens, please disable the conflicting mods or Natsumi features.

### "Why is userChrome.css so empty?"
Natsumi Browser uses a system where the userChrome.css file acts as a loader that loads the skin,
instead of being the file that contains all rules. This way, it's easier for users to quickly enable
and disable custom CSS.

## Troubleshooting
### "URLbar blur won't work!"
Make sure both `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` and `layout.css.backdrop-filter.force-enabled` are
set to true. Also make sure that you're using WebRender and hardware rendering.

### "Zen Browser lags a lot!"
This may be due to the URLbar blurring or animations (likely the blur). Set `natsumi.theme.disable-blur`
to false to disable the blur, and `natsumi.urlbar.light` to true to disable the animations.

### "I don't see any of the Natsumi options in about:config!"
These are custom options which you need to create. Type in the exact name, then press the plus button on
the right to create the config.

### "Tab groups aren't working!"
As of 2.4.1, tab groups have been removed.

### "Something's bugged!"
There may be Zen Mods or userchromes that you're using alongside Natsumi Browser that breaks things.
Please disable these then try again.

If the issue still persists, open an issue or report the bug to the developer through Discord.
